# Age-Stratified Complete Nutrient Database (ASCND)

## ⚠️ Research Purposes Only

This database is intended **strictly for research and educational purposes**. It is **not intended for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment**. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals and registered dietitians before making dietary changes or taking nutritional supplements.

## About This Project

This dataset represents a comprehensive attempt to map nutrients needed for **optimum living**, not merely essential survival. While government-established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) focus primarily on preventing deficiency diseases, this database explores what might constitute optimal intake levels for health, longevity, and well-being.

### Why Go Beyond RDAs?

Traditional RDAs are designed to meet the basic nutritional requirements for most healthy individuals and prevent deficiency-related diseases. However, they typically:

- **Focus on essential nutrients only**: RDAs generally cover only vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients recognized as essential for basic health
- **Exclude trace nutrients and bioactive compounds**: Many beneficial phytonutrients, antioxidants, conditionally essential amino acids, and other bioactive compounds are not included because official guidance assumes people obtain these through varied whole food diets

This database attempts to fill these gaps by including:
- Conditionally essential amino acids (glycine, glutamine, arginine, taurine)
- Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA) at optimal rather than minimum levels
- Beneficial phytonutrients (resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, lycopene)
- Antioxidants (Coenzyme Q10, beta-carotene, lutein)
- Probiotics for gut health
- Other bioactive compounds associated with health benefits in research literature

## Data Sources and Methodology

The nutrient values in this database come from a **three-tier approach**:

### 1. RDA Foundation (Primary Source)
The base layer consists of official Recommended Dietary Allowances from UK health agencies and similar governmental nutrition authorities. These values are marked with `source_type: "RDA"` in the dataset.

**Source**: UK Department of Health and other official government nutritional guidance documents

### 2. Research-Based Enhancement (Secondary Source)
Where peer-reviewed research suggests optimal intake levels that differ from or extend beyond RDAs, those values have been incorporated. These are marked with `source_type: "Research-based"` or `source_type: "Enhanced"` and include citations to published studies.

**Sources**: Peer-reviewed journals including but not limited to:
- Biofactors
- Clinical Nutrition
- American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
- Cardiovascular Research
- Sleep Medicine Reviews
- Journal of Medicinal Food
- Nutrients Journal
- And many others (see `source_name` and `source_url` fields in the data)

### 3. AI-Assisted Calculation (Tertiary Source - Use with Caution)
For nutrients where gaps remained, an AI-assisted reverse dietary calculation was performed. This involved:
- Analyzing optimal diet patterns (including baby food recipes and nutritionally complete meal plans)
- Reverse-engineering likely nutrient profiles
- Scaling values across age groups and physiological states

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Values marked with `source_type: "Amateur AI calculation"` should be treated with **significant skepticism**. These were generated by someone who is **not a professional nutritionist, dietitian, or medical doctor**. They represent educated estimates based on dietary patterns and should be verified against professional sources before any practical application.

## Data Accuracy Disclaimer

**Accuracy varies significantly by source type**:

- **RDA values**: Generally reliable, based on extensive clinical research and expert consensus
- **Research-based values**: Represent findings from published studies but may be subject to ongoing scientific debate
- **AI-calculated values**: Speculative estimates that have NOT been validated by nutrition professionals

Always check the `source_type`, `source_name`, and `source_url` fields for each nutrient to assess reliability.

## Infant Nutrition Warning

### For Infants 0-12 Months

**Human breast milk is the optimal and recommended source of nutrition for infants**, particularly those under 6 months of age. There is **no adequate substitute** for human milk during this critical developmental period. Breast milk provides:

- Perfect nutritional balance for infant development
- Antibodies and immune factors
- Easily digestible proteins and fats
- Optimal ratios of vitamins and minerals
- Bioactive compounds that support gut microbiome development
- Psychological and bonding benefits

While this database includes nutrient values for infants (0-6 months, 7-12 months), these are for **research and understanding purposes only**. The values for young infants are largely derived from breast milk composition studies and infant formula requirements.

**Never use this data to formulate infant feeding regimens without professional medical supervision.**

## Dataset Structure

The database includes the following fields:

- **nutrient**: Name of the nutrient or compound
- **gender**: Female, Male, Pregnant, Lactating
- **Min months**: Minimum age in months for this recommendation
- **Max months**: Maximum age in months for this recommendation
- **amount**: Recommended daily amount
- **unit**: Unit of measurement (mg, mcg, IU, CFU, etc.)
- **source_type**: Category of source (RDA, Research-based, Enhanced, Amateur AI calculation)
- **source_name**: Specific publication or authority
- **source_url**: DOI or URL to source document
- **notes**: Additional context about the nutrient

## Future Development Plans (TODO)

### Near-Term: Plant Source Mapping & Fermentation Research

**Building a plant-to-nutrient database** that maps which plants, algae, fungi, and fermented foods provide each nutrient with realistic serving sizes and bioavailability factors. Early focus: **simple jar fermentation protocols** (sugar + plant material + bacteria for several weeks) to reduce excess nutrients in nutrient-dense foods and break down anti-nutrients—particularly applicable to algae and mushrooms. Includes validation of preparation methods and synergistic nutrient combinations.

### Mid-Term: Closed-Loop Ecosystem Modeling

Develop models for **complete food production systems** that require only sunlight and recycled inputs. Integration of aquaponics (fish-plant symbiosis), algae cultivation, mushroom integration, humanure composting, urine nutrient capture, and greywater recycling. Focus on nutrient flow mapping, energy accounting, and scaling calculations to answer: *"What combination of cultivation systems produces complete nutrition for X people using Y square meters?"*

### Long-Term: Automated Food Systems

**Fully robotic ecosystem management** with machine vision harvesting, sensor-driven nutrient delivery, AI-optimized resource allocation, and predictive maintenance. Encompasses fermentation monitoring, meal assembly to meet precise nutritional targets, and closed-loop nutrient cycling with minimal human intervention.
